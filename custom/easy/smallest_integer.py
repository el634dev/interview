"""
Write a function that takes in a list of numbers and returns the smallest positive integer that is
not present in the list.

For example, given the input [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5, as 5 is the 
smallest positive integer that is not present in the list.

You can assume that the input list will only contain integers.
"""

# Constraints:
# The input list can have duplicates
# The input list can contain negative numbers
# The input list can be empty


# Example 1:
# input: [1, 2, 3] [0, -1, -5, 6] [5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0] []
# Expected output: 4 1 6 1
