"""
You are given a list of numbers and a target sum. Write a function that returns a pair of 
indices of the two numbers in the list that add up to the target sum.

You cannot use the same number twice to find the pair.
"""

# Example 1:
# Input: List of numbers = [2, 7, 11, 15] Target sum = 9
# Output: Indices of the pair: [0, 1]
# Explanation: The numbers at index 0 and index 1 in the list add up to 9 (2 + 7 = 9).)
